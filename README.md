Hello, 
My name is Grant Verhulst and I am a first year Master's student in 
the University of Kansas' computational hydrology group. I am 
researching the impact of land use and land cover change on land 
atmosphere coupling. I am also investigating the use of deep learning 
techniques for quanitfying land atmosphere coupling. In the past I 
have interned at NASA and EPA, and these experiences have led me 
toward a career in research. My ultimate career goal is to produce 
climate change research that will influence policymaking decisions.

For this course, I hope to:

1) Become more familiar with unix shell and git.

2) Improve my programming skills.

3) Increase my comfortability working in Anaconda and github.

4) Learn Earth Science programming etiquette.

5) Hear from other Earth Science students from across the 
country/world.
